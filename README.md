# Restaurant Billing System
## Project Overview

This is a **Restaurant Menu & Bill Generation System** developed in **C programming language**.  
It allows restaurant staff to manage menu items, take customer orders, and generate bills efficiently using a **console-based interface**.  

This project demonstrates fundamental **C programming concepts** like **structures, arrays, functions, and file handling**, making it an excellent **learning and portfolio project**.

## Features

- Add, remove, or modify menu items.
- Display the restaurant menu with prices.
- Take multiple customer orders.
- Automatically calculate the total bill.
- Apply taxes and generate a formatted bill.
- Optionally store orders (if file handling is implemented).

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Structures for menu and order management
  - Arrays for storing multiple items
  - Functions for modular design
  - File handling for data persistence (optional)
  - Loops and conditional statements for menu navigation

## About Project : 
This project is a basic prototype of a Restaurant Menu and Billing System developed in C programming. It demonstrates the core functionality of a restaurant billing process in a console-based environment.

**Key Features:**

Menu Management: Allows adding new items with their name and price, and viewing the current menu.

Order Processing: Takes customer orders by selecting menu items and specifying quantities.

Bill Generation: Calculates the total bill for the customer and displays a formatted summary.

Prototype Purpose: This implementation is a simple, beginner-friendly model designed to demonstrate fundamental C programming concepts like structures, arrays, functions, and user input handling.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced systems in the future, such as integrating file-based storage, tax calculations, discounts, or a graphical interface.



## Learning Outcomes
 
  - By using the Restaurant Billing System, you can:
 
  - Easily manage a restaurant menu by adding, viewing, or updating menu items.
 
  - Take customer orders and generate bills quickly and accurately.
 
  - Understand how a basic billing system works, making it easy to customize or expand for your own needs.
 
  - Learn to experiment with C programming by modifying menu items, prices, or order logic.
 
  - Optionally, extend the system with features like order history, taxes, discounts, or file-based storage for persistent data.

## Step 1: Open Terminal in VS Code

Open your project folder:
Restraunt Billing System (where your files are: main.c, menu.c, menu.h)

Open terminal: Ctrl + `` (backtick) or View → Terminal

## Step 2:Compile the Program
    gcc main.c menu.c -o restaurant.exe


This compiles your C files and creates restaurant.exe.

If no errors appear, compilation is successful.

## Run the Program
    .\restaurant.exe
### You should now see:
